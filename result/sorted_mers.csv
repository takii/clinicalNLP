Females of childbearing potential and males agree to use acceptable contraception for the duration of the study Note: A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year) according to the CDC criteria.30. These include progestin implants, intrauterine devices (IUDs), surgical (hysterectomy or tubal ligation; vasectomy) or abstinence. Use of methods with higher failure rate (such as progestin injectables, combined oral hormonal contraceptives, condoms, and diaphragms) will not be acceptable when used alone, but they could be considered, if used in combination with another method (for example, a female using combined oral contraceptives if her male partner is sterile, or if she and her non-sterile male partner use a double-barrier method), after consultation with the DMID MM. All males will be required to use a barrier method (condoms) for the duration of the study

Screening laboratory tests, are in the normal reference range with acceptable exceptions
Notes:

If urinalysis by dipstick is abnormal, a complete urinalysis with microscopic evaluation will be performed and the results will supersede the results of the dipstick for blood, glucose and protein.
Menstruating females failing inclusion criteria due to a positive blood on urine test (dipstick or microscopic urinalysis) may be retested following cessation of menses. Do not exclude subjects with <5 RBC/HPF.
Other laboratory values that are outside the range of eligibility but are thought to be due to an acute condition or due to collection or laboratory error may be repeated once.

Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10-14 days and again within 24 hours prior to starting cycle 1 of lenalidomide; a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months; FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing)
Effective contraception must be used by patients participating in lenalidomide therapy, and all patients must agree to counseling by a trained counselor every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure; females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control: one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide, during lenalidomide therapy, during dose interruptions, and for at least 28 days following discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy; females of childbearing potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed; males receiving lenalidomide must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with females of childbearing potential even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy

Serum creatinine =< 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 56 days prior to randomization)
Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.0 x ULN (within 56 days prior to randomization)

Patients must not have any serious medical condition or any other unstable medical co-morbidity, or psychiatric illness that will prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form or will place the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she participates in the study
Patients must not have a history of thrombo-embolic events within 3 years prior to study randomization
Patients must not have known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 seropositivity because HIV can be an alternate cause of anemia.
