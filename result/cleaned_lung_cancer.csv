Up to a maximum of three lines of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease (defined below) and at least one of erlotinib or gefitinib for advanced/ metastatic disease (defined below) should have failed.

Exchange of one chemotherapy agent for another within a combination chemotherapy regimen is not considered a new regimen in the following circumstances

carboplatin is substituted for cisplatin due to nephrotoxicity
one agent in the combination regimen is changed due to hypersensitivity occurring in the first cycle.
Chemotherapy for Advanced/Metastatic Disease:

Patients must have recovered from any reversible toxic effects and at least 21 days must have elapsed from the last dose and prior to randomization (14 days from the last dose for chemotherapy regimens administered on a weekly schedule). Further palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy must not be planned.

Patients < 70 years:

Must have received 1 and up to a maximum of 3prior chemotherapy regimens (at least one of the three must have been a combination regimen and at least one must have contained platinum).

Patients ≥ 70 years (generally accepted as being at the time of the administration of the first regimen of chemotherapy for advanced disease):

Must have received 1 and up to a maximum of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for their disease. These may have been single agent chemotherapy regimens and a platinum agent is not required in keeping with current standards of practice.

Adjuvant regimens < 12 months prior to randomization and combined chemotherapy/radiation regimens for irresectable locally advanced stage III disease (irrespective of timing), are considered to be for advanced/metastatic disease and constitute one of the 3 permissible regimens. Patients must have recovered from any reversible treatment related toxicities prior to randomization.

EGFR Inhibitor Therapy: Patients may only be enrolled after failure of prior gefitinib or erlotinib for advanced or metastatic disease. Patients who have received adjuvant gefitinib or erlotinib for completely resected NSCLC and who have recurred < 12 months after discontinuing erlotinib or gefitinib are eligible.

Patients with a significant cardiac history, even if controlled, should have a LVEF > 50%.
Patients with untreated brain or meningeal metastases are not eligible (CT scans are not required to rule this out unless there is a clinical suspicion of CNS disease). Patients with treated CNS disease who have radiologic or clinical evidence of stable brain metastases, with no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage in the brain lesion, are eligible providing that they are asymptomatic and do not require corticosteroids (must have discontinued steroids at least 1 week prior to randomization).

Mean QTc with Bazetts correction > 470msec in screening ECG or history of familial long QT syndrome.
Drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism are prohibited, since PF-804 is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor in in vitro assays. These inhibitors or inducers are prohibited from 7 days prior to the first dose until the end of treatment with PF-80These include: S-metoprolol, propafenone, timolol, amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, paroxetine, haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine, codeine, flecainide, mexilletine, tamoxifen, venlafaxine. Lidocaine may be used with clinical monitoring (including telemetry). Opiates such as morphine, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and tramadol can be used as substitutes to replace codeine. Use of these opiates should be monitored for altered analgesia during treatment with PF-804 as they may be partly metabolized by CYP2DIf PF-804 is administered with drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring for exaggerated effect and/or toxicities is recommended.

• Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions while taking paclitaxel and therefore are not considered effective contraceptive methods for this study when used as a single agent. Therefore, it is highly recommended that a concomitant barrier method be used with oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives. The investigator shall counsel the patient accordingly.
