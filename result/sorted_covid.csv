INCLUSION CRITERIA:


The protocol is open to people of all ages:
i. Only patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age can be enrolled at the Clinical Center
ii. Patients who are < 2 years old may be enrolled only remotely and will not be seen at the Clinical Center.

Must have (or be suspected of having) a viral infection, that is of interest to LID investigators. Alternatively, must be a close contact of someone who has (or is suspected of having) a viral infection that is of interest to LID investigators.
Adults who are unable to provide initial consent may be enrolled providing procedures per Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) standard operation procedure (SOP) 14E have been followed.


",,"
Patients who are unable to safely undergo study procedures and tests.

Patients unwilling to have samples collected and stored for future use.
INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:
-Children:
Children younger than 2 years of age will be enrolled only remotely from non-NIH medical facilities and will not be seen at the Clinical Center, because children of this age are susceptible to viral infections, some of which are more likely to occur in this very young population or could be more severe. Title 45 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46 Subpart D and (OHRSPHRPP SOP 14D) will be followed to comply with research involving children. The proposed research poses a risk no greater than that encountered with blood tests or other minimally invasive tests ordered as part of a routine history and physical examination. The PI will ensure that appropriate permission from each child s parent(s) or guardian has been obtained for participation in this study.
-Pregnant Women:
Pregnant women are eligible to participate in this study as they are susceptible to viral infections, some of which may be more severe in this patient population. This study provides an opportunity to learn more about viral infections in pregnant women. This information may be meaningful in informing disease severity, clinical practice for treating pregnant women, or in leading to new treatments for this population. This information cannot be gained without the participation of pregnant women. The primary procedure performed under this protocol is a blood draw but other procedures may be performed and are considered minimal risk in clinical practice. No procedures that would affect a developing fetus or affect a baby through breastfeeding are performed in the protocol.
-Decisionally Impaired Adults:
Adults who are unable to provide initial informed consent are eligible to enroll. Also adults who lose the ability to provide on-going consent subsequent to giving initial consent may continue to participate. These adults are susceptible to viral infections and we can learn about viral infections that may occur in this population. Institutionalized adults will not be enrolled. The procedures utilized are clinically considered to be of minimal risk

Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.
Be able to understand and agrees to comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits.
Agrees to the collection of venous blood per protocol.
Male or non-pregnant female, >/= to 18 years of age at time of enrollment.
Body Mass Index (BMI) 18.0-35.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (< 56 years of age), at screening; BMI 18.0-30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (>/= 56 years of age), at screening.

Women of childbearing potential* must agree to use or have practiced true abstinence** or use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception.***, **** Note: These criteria are applicable to females in a heterosexual relationship and child-bearing potential (i.e., the criteria do not apply to subjects in a same sex relationship).


Not of childbearing potential - post-menopausal females (defined as having a history of amenorrhea for at least one year) or a documented status as being surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or Essure(R) placement).


True abstinence is 100% of time no sexual intercourse (male's penis enters the female's vagina). (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception).


Acceptable forms of primary contraception include monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject's first vaccination, intrauterine devices, birth control pills, and injectable/implantable/insertable hormonal birth control products.

Must use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception for at least 30 days prior to the first vaccination and at least one acceptable primary form of contraception for 60 days after the last vaccination.








Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to each vaccination.

Male subjects of childbearing potential*: use of condoms to ensure effective contraception with a female partner of childbearing potential from first vaccination until 60 days after the last vaccination.
*Biological males who are post-pubertal and considered fertile until permanently sterile by bilateral orchiectomy or vasectomy.

Male subjects agree to refrain from sperm donation from the time of first vaccination until 60 days after the last vaccination.

In good health.*
*As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic medical diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations, emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI) or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.

Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).
Pulse no greater than 100 beats per minute.
Systolic blood pressure (BP) is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.

Moderate to severe ARDS as determined by the following criteria (adapted from the Berlin criteria):

Bilateral opacities must be present on a chest radiograph or computed tomographic (CT) scan. These opacities are not fully explained by pleural effusions, lobar collapse, lung collapse, or pulmonary nodules.
Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. An objective assessment (e.g., echocardiography) to exclude hydrostatic pulmonary edema is required if no risk factors for ARDS are present.

Moderate to severe impairment of oxygenation must be present, as defined by the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). The severity of the hypoxemia defines the severity of the ARDS:

Moderate ARDS: e PaO2/FiO2 >100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and ≤200 mmHg, on ventilator settings that include positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥5 centimeters (cm) of water OR
Severe ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 ≤100 mmHg on ventilator settings that include PEEP ≥5 cm of water

Recovered to Grade 1, baseline or established as sequela, from all toxic effects of previous therapy (except alopecia, neuropathy, or autoimmune endocrinopathies with stable endocrine replacement therapy).
Screening and post-dose tumor biopsies are required from all participants in the expansion cohorts and are optional during dose escalation, however once a DLx is identified at which there is clear evidence of TAK-981 biological effect (that is, observation of peripheral lymphopenia, induction of cytokines/chemokines, type 1 interferon (IFN) signature in blood, drug-related toxicity or antitumor effect), subsequent participants must agree in providing a fresh tumor biopsy during the screening period and a second tumor biopsy as requested in the schedule of events (SOE). The lesion accessible for biopsy may not be the only target lesion and should not be located in a previously irradiated field (unless this index lesion has progressive disease >=20% post radiation). Ideally, the same lesion should be biopsied before treatment and on treatment whenever possible.
Consented to undergo serial skin punch biopsies (dose escalation only).
Suitable venous access for safe drug administration and the study-required PK and pharmacodynamics sampling.

Women of child-bearing potential participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male participants should avoid impregnating a female partner.
